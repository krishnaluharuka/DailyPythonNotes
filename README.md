## ✅ Completed Topics So Far

### 1️⃣ Python Basics  
- What is Python? 🤔  
- Why is it *everywhere* in data science & AI?  
- Installation, setup, syntax 101  
- Writing your first `print("Hello, world!")`

---

### 2️⃣ Data Types in Python  
Covered with ✨ definitions, examples & real use cases ✨  
- 🧵 **String**  
- 🔢 **Integer & Float**  
- 🧺 **List**  
- 📚 **Tuple**  
- 🧠 **Dictionary**  
- 🎯 **Set**

---

### 3️⃣ Loops 🔁  
- `for` loop — iterate like a pro  
- `while` loop — until your condition says stop  
- `break`, `continue`, `pass` explained like vibes 😎  
- Practical usage with mini problems & patterns

---

### 4️⃣ Conditionals 🔍  
- `if`, `elif`, `else` — Python’s decision makers  
- Use cases: grading system, authentication logic, etc.

---

### 5️⃣ Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) 🧱  
> Full breakdown with clear definitions, examples, syntax & hands-on code  
- 🔧 **Class & Object**  
- 🎯 **Constructor (`__init__`)**  
- 📜 **Instance vs Class Variables**  
- 🔁 **Inheritance**  
- 🛠️ **Polymorphism**  
- 📦 **Encapsulation**  
- 🕵️ **Abstraction**  
- 🧪 Some OOP-based mini projects (like `Bank Account`, `Student System`)

---

## 🔄 Currently Working On  
- 📁 **File Handling**  
  - Opening, reading, writing files  
  - Using `with open()`, file modes (`r`, `w`, `a`, etc.)  
  - Projects coming soon...

---

## ⏭️ Coming Soon (Data Science Essentials)  
> Stepping into the world of Data Science one topic at a time...  
- 🧮 **NumPy** — arrays like magic  
- 🐼 **Pandas** — dataframes, data cleaning  
- 📊 **Matplotlib** — basic to cool visualizations  
- 📈 **Seaborn**, **Scikit-learn**, and more 🔥
